# Hospital Management System

This Java project is a console-based Hospital Management System. It utilizes MySQL for database management and provides functionalities for managing patients and doctors, as well as booking appointments.

#### Features

1. **Add Patient**: Allows the addition of new patients to the system.
2. **View Patient**: Retrieves and displays details of patients.
3. **View Doctor**: Retrieves and displays details of doctors.
4. **Book Appointment**: Facilitates the booking of appointments between patients and doctors.

#### Project Structure

- **HospitalManagementSystem.java**: The main class that drives the application. It provides the user interface for interacting with the system and connects to the MySQL database.
- **Patient.java**: Manages patient-related operations such as adding and viewing patient details.
- **Doctor.java**: Manages doctor-related operations such as viewing doctor details and checking doctor availability by ID.

#### Database Schema

The project requires a MySQL database with the following schema:

**Database Name**: `Hospital_db`

**Tables**:
- `patients`
  - `id` (INT) - Primary Key
  - `name` (VARCHAR)
  - `age` (INT)
  - `gender` (VARCHAR)
  - `diagnosis` (VARCHAR)
  
- `doctors`
  - `id` (INT) - Primary Key
  - `name` (VARCHAR)
  - `specialization` (VARCHAR)

#### How to Run

1. Set up the MySQL database using the schema provided above.
2. Update the database connection details in `HospitalManagementSystem.java`:
   ```java
   private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3307/Hospital_db";
   private static final String username = "admin";
   private static final String password = "admin";
   ```
3. Compile and run the application using your preferred Java IDE or command line.

#### Dependencies

- MySQL JDBC Driver
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
